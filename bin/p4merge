# A slightly more sophisticated wrapper than the one perforce.com suggests,
# for the P4 merge shim executable on OSX. The article at
#     http://kb.perforce.com/AllPerforceApplications/StandAloneClients/\
#     P4merge/CommandLineP..rgeOnMacOsX
# suggests a wrapper script, but not one that takes care of the fact that
# P4 merge requires absolute paths to its inputs.
