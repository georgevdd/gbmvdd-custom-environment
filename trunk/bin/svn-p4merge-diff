# Wraps p4merge to accommodate differences between SVN's idea of diff command
# line arguments and P4 merge's expectations. SVN automatically supplies
# several flags that P4 merge doesn't understand. This script assumes that
# SVN will supply the names of the two files to diff as the last two
# command-line arguments.
